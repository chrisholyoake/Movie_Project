## Movie Search Engine
Using the D3 JavaScript library, we created a dashboard that allows users to search for a movie title & query the OMDB API & return the following details:  the plot, release date, director, rating, genre, runtime, imdb rating, production company, & poster.

## Visualizations 
For this project, we looked at the correlation between a movieâ€™s rating (G, PG, PG-13, R, etc.) and its Metacritic score.
What are the most common movie genres among the top 250 movies of all time?
